# Vector 2D
 
## An attempt to recreate the Impulse Physics engine by Randy Gaul

## REMINDER : after completing the physics engine itself write a c++ program using opengl that writes into a file how much time each function took and then read the data from the file to show a bar graph of the amount of time each function took
